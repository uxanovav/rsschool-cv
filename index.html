                         I love to draw and sculpt, which is why I started studying 3D modeling at school age, but I never made it past creating my own room.
                         I got acquainted with programming at the age of 13, having signed up for free courses in QBASIC and PASCAL. 
                         It was then that I decided to connect my life with IT technologies. 
                         Preferences for the profession of a frontend developer arose because of the clarity of the result.
